Our housing options are designed to assist families who are struggling with credit or rental histories as a result of their abusive relationship.

Clients who participate must also be participating in case management services with a Hope Alliance advocate.\n\nHope Alliance's Emergency shelter -  can house up to 35 adults and children who stay for an average of around 30 days. Within 24 hours of entering the shelter, survivors are assigned a case manager who will meet with them weekly. At that first meeting, the resident and case manager will work collaboratively to develop a list of line items and goals that that individual resident hopes to achieve while in shelter. These goals can be both short and long term goals. The residents also can meet with a legal advocate and a crisis counselor, if needed. Residents have access to a clothing closet, basic toiletries (shampoos, soap, lotions, razors, hair products, etc.), and a plethora of food items for meals and snacks. We encourage the future residents to bring only a reasonable amount of personal items with them.
