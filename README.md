### Rules

1. We will make absolutely **no** use of Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning. 

2. We will not be making it easier to apply for Section 8, until we have researched and concluded that it does not spread crime across cities.

3. We will not be making a group home database, until we have researched and concluded that group homes do not lower the quality of life of the neighbors in the neighborhood in which group homes are.
