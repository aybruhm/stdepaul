### Rules

1. We will make absolutely **no** use of Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning. This includes not using even simple ML algorithms like linear regression and logistic regression, and this also includes not making use of analytic methods like the Normal Equation. 

2. We will not be making it easier to apply for Section 8, until we have researched and concluded that it does not spread crime across cities.

3. We will not be making a group home database, until we have researched and concluded that group homes do not lower the quality of life of the neighbors in the neighborhood in which group homes are.
